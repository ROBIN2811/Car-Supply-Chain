# Car-Supply-Chain
This repository contains Power BI files and documentation related to an interactive dashboard created for analyzing the car supply chain. The dashboard visualizes key performance indicators and insights derived from the analysis of supply chain data.
## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis includes information about various stages of the car supply chain, such as production, distribution, and sales.

I have provided the dataset that I used for analysis [Car Supply Chain.xlsx]
## Methodology
- Data Preparation: Cleaning and transforming the raw data for analysis.
- Dashboard Creation: Utilizing Power BI to design interactive visualizations and metrics for monitoring supply chain performance.
## Visualization
The Power BI dashboard provides insights into supply chain efficiency, inventory levels, and production trends.

I have provided the dashboard [Car Supply Chain (USA).pbix]
## Conclusion
'The analysis enhances understanding of the car supply chain dynamics and identifies areas for optimization.'

I have provided a summary report for this project [Car Supply Chain (USA).pdf]
## Further development if needed:
- Incorporate real-time data streaming for dynamic updates.
- Expand analysis to include predictive analytics for demand forecasting.
